what are jobs and explain types of jobs
Jobs are tasks that jenkins performs ,such as building,testing and deploying 
->we have different types of jobs available,but we use mainly 3:
     1.Freestyle job
     2.Pipeline
     3.Multibranch pipeline
1.Freestyle job:
   ---------
->In freestyle job,we can write a basic code and build it by selecting options
->It is simple and easy method for beginners
->But for organisations,we can't use this method
2.Pipeline:
   -----
->pipeline is the important jobs in jenkins
->It is the scripted way to define ci/cd process in jenins
->we write ci/cd process in groovy language
->we write the code in a file named as " jenkinsfile " and saved it in github repo
->jenkins configure it from repo and run the jobs by using pipeline steps in jenkinsfile
#structure:     
   -----
->we have many stages and steps 
   pipeline{
      agent any
      stages{
        stage("build"){
	  steps{
	     echo "mvn clean install"
	  }
	}
      }
   }
->we can write pipeline in 2 ways
  1.Declarative pipeline: It is easier and understandable way
  2.Scripted pipeline: It is flexible but complex
3.Multibranch pipeline:
   ----------------
->It is similar to pipeline but here we build all the branches
->we can write same pipeline jenkinsfile and save it in all branches
->or we change the pipeline steps in another branch
