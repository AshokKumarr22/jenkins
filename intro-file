what is jenkins?ci/cd concepts
Jenkins is a open source automation server written in java language used for continous integration/continous deployment

why jenkins
It helps for the process of building,testing and deployment of software
key-features:
----------
free and opensource,lots of plugins,supports pipelines

what are ci/cd
ci-continous integration 
->It is the process of building and testing 
cd-continous delivery/deployment
->After the completion of ci process ,we had some war/jar files
->jenkins automatically deploy that files into server is known as deployment process
->if we have a manager approval for deploying stage,jenkins not deploy it
->we will deploy it after the approval acceptance means contimous delivery


Install  jenkins(linux/windows or docker)
Go to aws console and create a server named as jenkins..allow port 8080 security group..connect to server..open jenkins io website
and select ubuntu flavour,copy the links and enter into server ,finally entered"install jenkins" after installation..
we install java openjdk21 and entered systemctl start jenkins ,systemctl status jenkins and also we know the java --version
now go to aws and copy the public ip and entered in chrome,we get the link,now copy the link and use cat command before link
we get a password,entered the password in that link ,now jenkins opened and installed suggested plugins,now we can see jenkins ui dashboard

what are jobs/projects and builds
->Jobs and projects are same,it is the tasks for running the process of building,testing,deployment 
->Builds are actual execution of job
->we have some types in jobs/project:
  1.freestyle project
  2.pipeline project
  3.Multibranch pipeline project

what is scm
scm-source code management,connect jenkins to git in manage jenkins and give the repo url and credentials to jenkins,it clones the code from scm
